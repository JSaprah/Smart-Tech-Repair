# Smart Tech Repair

## Project Description

Smart Tech Repair is a small business specialized in repairs of phones, laptops, tablets, gaming, (smwart)watches and much more. The company aims to deliver fast and reliable service to its customers. The customers can either do an online booking or walk-in to the store during the opening hours. 

Online bookings: Customers lookup for information on the business profile of the company on Google and give a call to Smart Tech. On the phone they request for information such as the price and the availibility. The company needs information about the device and the issue. As this process goes all over the phone mistakes are likely to happen.

When the customer brings in the device, the device is tested (if the device is still in working condition). The customer leaves behind the device together with the password of the device for testing throughout the repair and the contact details. When the repair is done the technician calls the customer to say that the device is ready for collection.

## Scope
During this project the focus will be on the device types: phones, laptops and tablets. As these categories are the most common onces with the most repairing requests. Furthermore, the aim to solve the following issues:
1. Create a online booking system for the customer so that the customer can see the information online, make online booking according to the availibility.
2. Create a backend for the technician so that the correct customer information is visible.
3. Create a system so that the technician can update the customer about the status of the repair.
4. Create a system that sends an invoice to the customer on click of a button by the technician. //nice to have
